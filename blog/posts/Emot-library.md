# The Emot Library for Emoji & Emoticons

I saw [an article](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/04/five-cool-python-libraries-data-science.html) today called “Five Cool Libraries for Data Science” so I clicked through. I figured I would see which ones--maybe all of them--I was already familiar with.

As it turned out, the article wasn’t about the usual data science libraries I was expecting. I wasn’t familiar with any of them! So I took some time to read over the different libraries & learn about them. One that really stood out to me as useful for a lot of work I do is [Emot, found in this repo](https://github.com/NeelShah18/emot).

Emot helps convert both emoticons and emojis into words. Both [emojis](https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/) and [emoticons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_emoticons) can carry a lot of meaning with regards to sentiment in particular, so it’s useful to have a tool that allows them to be easily included and parsed. 

Emot can be [pip installed](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/):

`$ pip install emot --upgrade`

Or you can install it from the master branch:

`$ git clone https://github.com/NeelShah18/emot.git

$ cd emot

$ python setup.py install`

The developers say that all emoji & emoticon definitions come from reliable sources & list several links, including the [unicode full emoji list](http://www.unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html). I’m looking forward to giving Emot a try!
